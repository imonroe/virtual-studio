# Feature Specification: Google Analytics Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to add Google Analytics to this app"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Analytics tracking integration for Virtual Studio
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: content creators, developers
   � Actions: track user behavior, measure engagement
   � Data: page views, user interactions, usage patterns
   � Constraints: privacy compliance, performance impact
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which GA version - GA4 or Universal Analytics?] - Use GA4
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific events/interactions to track?] - Don't track any special events, just normal visits, pageviews, etc.
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Privacy compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA)?] Make it GDPR compliant
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User visits app, analytics tracks engagement
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Track page views, user interactions, session data
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   � Analytics events, user sessions, interaction metrics
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding GA version and privacy compliance"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a Virtual Studio developer, I want to understand how content creators use the application so that I can make data-driven decisions about feature improvements and user experience optimization.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits the Virtual Studio application, **When** they navigate between different sections, **Then** page views and navigation patterns are tracked in Google Analytics
2. **Given** a user interacts with studio controls (backgrounds, overlays, settings), **When** they perform actions, **Then** interaction events are recorded with relevant context
3. **Given** a user spends time using the application, **When** their session ends, **Then** engagement metrics (session duration, bounce rate) are captured
4. **Given** analytics data is collected, **When** developers access Google Analytics dashboard, **Then** they can view usage patterns and user behavior insights

### Edge Cases

- What happens when users have ad blockers or privacy extensions that block analytics?
- How does the system handle analytics failures without impacting app functionality?
- What data is collected for users who may be streaming to audiences (privacy considerations)?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST track page views and navigation within the Virtual Studio application
- **FR-002**: System MUST record user interactions with key features (background changes, overlay toggles, control panel usage)
- **FR-003**: System MUST measure session engagement metrics (duration, bounce rate, pages per session)
- **FR-004**: System MUST operate without impacting application performance or core functionality
- **FR-005**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Analytics version not specified - GA4 or Universal Analytics?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle analytics service failures gracefully without breaking app functionality
- **FR-007**: System MUST comply with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Privacy requirements not specified - GDPR, CCPA, other regulations?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific events to track not defined - which user actions are most valuable?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Data retention period not specified]
- **FR-010**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: User consent mechanism not defined - opt-in, opt-out, or automatic?]

### Key Entities

- **Analytics Event**: Represents user interactions and behaviors (page views, clicks, feature usage)
- **User Session**: Represents a continuous period of user engagement with the application
- **Interaction Metric**: Quantitative data about user behavior patterns and feature adoption
