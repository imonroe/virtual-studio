# Implementation Plan: Google Analytics Integration

**Branch**: `001-i-want-to` | **Date**: 2025-09-17 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-i-want-to/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → Feature spec loaded: Google Analytics GA4 integration for Virtual Studio
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Project Type: web (React frontend with Vite)
   → Structure Decision: Single project with existing React architecture
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → No violations detected (simple analytics integration)
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → Research GA4 gtag integration for React/Vite
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Post-design constitution check
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Simple Google Analytics GA4 integration for Virtual Studio React application using environment variable configuration for the tracking ID. Implementation will use gtag library for basic pageview tracking with GDPR compliance considerations.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: JavaScript/TypeScript with React 18 and Vite 7.1.2  
**Primary Dependencies**: gtag library for GA4, existing React/Vite build system  
**Storage**: Environment variables for GA tracking ID (VITE_GA_TRACKING_ID)  
**Testing**: Existing build system (npm run build, npm run lint)  
**Target Platform**: Browser-based React SPA (Single Page Application)
**Project Type**: single (existing React application structure)  
**Performance Goals**: No impact on 60fps rendering performance  
**Constraints**: GDPR compliant, graceful failure handling, environment-configurable  
**Scale/Scope**: Single tracking ID, basic pageview analytics, minimal implementation

**User Specification**: Keep implementation simple, use environment variable to set GA account

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

The constitution template is not fully defined, but based on standard principles:
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Simple gtag implementation without complex abstractions
- ✅ **Configuration**: Environment variable approach follows 12-factor app principles
- ✅ **Non-breaking**: Analytics integration won't impact existing functionality
- ✅ **Performance**: Async loading won't block critical rendering path

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project (matches existing Virtual Studio React architecture)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - GA4 gtag integration best practices for React
   - GDPR compliance implementation patterns
   - Environment variable configuration for Vite
   - Error handling and graceful degradation patterns

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Research Task 1: "Research GA4 gtag library integration for React SPA applications"
   Research Task 2: "Find GDPR-compliant analytics implementation patterns"
   Research Task 3: "Research Vite environment variable configuration for production builds"
   Research Task 4: "Find error handling patterns for third-party analytics services"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - AnalyticsConfig: tracking ID, enabled state
   - AnalyticsEvent: basic page view events
   - No complex data modeling needed (simple integration)

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Analytics service interface (init, track pageview, error handling)
   - Environment variable contract (VITE_GA_TRACKING_ID)
   - Component integration points
   - Output TypeScript interfaces to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Analytics service initialization tests
   - Environment variable validation tests
   - Graceful failure tests
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Basic pageview tracking scenario
   - Environment configuration scenario  
   - GDPR compliance scenario
   - Error handling scenario

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for Claude Code
   - Add GA4 analytics integration details to existing CLAUDE.md
   - Update with new analytics service patterns
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md updates

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Environment setup task [P]
- Analytics service creation task [P]
- Component integration tasks
- Testing and validation tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Service before component integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)
- Environment setup first (required for all testing)

**Estimated Output**: 8-12 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No constitutional violations identified. This is a simple, well-bounded feature integration.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
