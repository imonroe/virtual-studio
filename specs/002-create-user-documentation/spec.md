# Feature Specification: User Documentation Page

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-user-documentation`  
**Created**: 2025-09-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create user documentation on a separate page of the application. Include all the information a user might need to operate the virtual studio app."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature: Add comprehensive user documentation as a separate page
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Content creators, streamers, broadcast producers
   ’ Actions: Read documentation, learn features, follow tutorials
   ’ Data: Documentation content, tutorials, feature explanations
   ’ Constraints: Must be accessible within the app, comprehensive coverage
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Documentation format preferences - written guides vs video tutorials vs interactive demos?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should documentation be searchable/filterable?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary scenario: User needs help using a specific feature
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement focused on documentation accessibility and completeness
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Documentation sections, feature guides, tutorial content
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Spec focuses on user needs for learning the application
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content creator using Virtual Studio for live streaming, I want to access comprehensive documentation within the application so that I can learn how to use all features effectively without leaving my workflow or searching external resources.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I'm new to Virtual Studio, **When** I click on a "Help" or "Documentation" link, **Then** I should see a comprehensive guide covering all application features
2. **Given** I'm trying to set up a specific feature like lower thirds, **When** I access the documentation, **Then** I should find step-by-step instructions for that feature
3. **Given** I'm streaming live and need quick help, **When** I access documentation, **Then** I should be able to open it in a new tab/window without disrupting my current studio setup
4. **Given** I want to learn about OBS integration, **When** I browse the documentation, **Then** I should find clear instructions for setting up browser sources and optimal settings
5. **Given** I'm looking for keyboard shortcuts, **When** I check the documentation, **Then** I should see a complete list of all available shortcuts organized by category

### Edge Cases
- What happens when documentation is accessed on mobile devices or smaller screens?
- How does documentation handle feature updates or new capabilities?
- What if a user wants to print or share documentation sections?
- How does documentation work for users with accessibility needs (screen readers, high contrast)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Application MUST provide a dedicated documentation page accessible via navigation menu
- **FR-002**: Documentation MUST cover all major application features including backgrounds, graphics, overlays, and controls
- **FR-003**: Documentation MUST include step-by-step tutorials for common workflows (setting up OBS, creating lower thirds, using presets)
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST provide keyboard shortcuts reference organized by feature category
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST include OBS Studio integration instructions with recommended settings
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST be accessible without disrupting current studio session (new tab/window capability)
- **FR-007**: Documentation MUST include visual examples and screenshots demonstrating key features
- **FR-008**: Documentation MUST provide troubleshooting section for common issues
- **FR-009**: Documentation MUST include getting started guide for new users
- **FR-010**: Documentation MUST be optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing

*Clarification needed:*
- **FR-011**: Documentation MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: include search functionality - should users be able to search within documentation?]
- **FR-012**: Documentation MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: update mechanism - how should documentation stay current with feature changes?]
- **FR-013**: Documentation MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: interactive elements - should there be interactive tutorials or demos?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Documentation Section**: Represents major feature categories (Backgrounds, Graphics, Overlays, Controls, OBS Integration)
- **Tutorial Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for specific workflows with visual aids
- **Feature Reference**: Detailed explanation of individual features and their options
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Comprehensive list of shortcuts organized by function and feature
- **Troubleshooting Entry**: Common problems and their solutions with diagnostic steps
- **Getting Started Guide**: Onboarding content for new users including basic setup and first-time use
